# Projects & Challenges #

####  [Chinese Loans to Africa (CLA) project](https://github.com/thehorsesking/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/cla.sql "CLA project") <br /> ####
Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio project which is a real data of Chinese loan given to African countries from year 2000 to 2020. 
The Chinese Loans to Africa (CLA) Database is a data project tracking loan commitments from Chinese policy and commercial banks, 
government entities, companies and other financiers, to African governments and state-owned enterprises. As of March 29, 2021, the CLA Database is managed by the 
[Boston University Global Development Policy Center](https://www.bu.edu/gdp/chinese-loans-to-africa-database/ ).  <br /><br />
I used this dataset to find out : <br/>
  * Which country received the maximum loan 
  * Which lender gave the maximum loan
  * What types of projects are heavily funded by Chinese government in Africa
